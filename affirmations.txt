All the cells and atoms of my body are working together to create perfect health.
I stay calm and relaxed by reqular meditation.
I enjoy exercises that strengthen my body and mind
What would it look like to be living my ideal life?
I have everything I need inside me now.
I am abundant.
I forgive myself for what I have done, and I forgive all those who have harmed me.
My teachers are everyone I encounter.
I am grateful for everything I have.
